### HTTPS Server / SSL Certification

Instructions on how to get set up with HTTPS

1. Create a key.pem / cert.pem file in the root directory of the project. (Same folder as index.js). Use this command:
  ```
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 30

  // For passcode, type 'beerly' for now. You can change the passcode in server/middleware/SSL.js.
  // For Common Name, type 'localhost'.
  // For everything else, you can just leave it blank.
  ```
1. Files have already been added to .gitignore so don't worry about adding them.
1. Start the server as you normally would.
```
npm start
```
1. Go to 'https://localhost:5000' to reach the server. Use https from now on. If you're using Chrome, it's going to complain that it's insecure. Just hit the 'Advanced' button and click 'Continue anyway'. You only have to do this once.

#### GET /api/beers/\<Brewery Name>
This endpoint is needed for the BeerList component. It makes an API request to BreweryDB to retrieve a list of available beers from a brewery.
```

},

```
